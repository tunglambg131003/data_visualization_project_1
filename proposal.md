# **Proposal: Top Hit Songs Data Analysis & Visualization**

## **1. Introduction** 

Music is an integral part of human life, shaping our emotions and cultural identity. From birth, we have a natural inclination to perceive and follow rhythms, while the prevailing musical styles and trends continuously evolve over time. Songs that achieve top-charting success do not emerge randomly; they serve as reflections of popular culture and, at times, symbols of societal transformation.

By analyzing the key figures (artists) and characteristics (genres, audio features, etc.) that define these ever-changing musical trends, we can gain valuable insights into the evolution of music. 

Specifically, by examining top hit since 1960, this study aims to explore:  

1. The shifts in musical genres over time.  
2. The progression of audio features in hit songs.  
3. The most dominant artists on the charts.  
4. The peak periods of top artistsâ€™ careers.  
5. The musical preferences of leading artists, particularly regarding key selection.
