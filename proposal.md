# **Proposal: Top Hit Songs Data Analysis & Visualization**

## **1. Introduction** 

Music is an integral part of human life, shaping our emotions and cultural identity. From birth, we have a natural inclination to perceive and follow rhythms, while the prevailing musical styles and trends continuously evolve over time. Songs that achieve top-charting success do not emerge randomly; they serve as reflections of popular culture and, at times, symbols of societal transformation.

By analyzing the key figures (artists) and characteristics (genres, audio features, etc.) that define these ever-changing musical trends, we can gain valuable insights into the evolution of music. 

Specifically, by examining top hit songs since 1960, this study aims to explore:  

 - The shifts in musical genres over time.
 - The progression of audio features in hit songs.  
 - The most dominant artists on the charts.
 - The peak periods of top artistsâ€™ careers.
 - The musical preferences of leading artists, particularly regarding key selection.  

## **2. Dataset Description**  

We will use two primary datasets for this analysis:  

### **Billboard Hot 100 Dataset**

- **date**: The date when the song appeared on the Billboard chart.  
- **title**: The title of the song.
