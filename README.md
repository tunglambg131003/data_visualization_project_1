# ðŸ“Š Data Visualization Project 1 - Billboard Top Hit Songs Data Analysis & Visualization

## Overview

Music is a universal language that transcends geographical, cultural, and generational boundaries. It plays a central role in human expression, identity, and social interaction. As both an art form and a reflection of societal values, music evolves in tandem with cultural shifts, technological advances, and changes in public taste. Understanding how music trends have changed over time offers valuable insight into broader patterns in entertainment, culture, and technology. 

In this project, we analyze over sixty years of Billboard Hot 100 chart data to examine trends in popular music. The Billboard Hot 100 is a widely accepted benchmark for song popularity in the United States, incorporating data from radio airplay, sales, and streaming platforms. Our analysis aims to uncover how musical features, genres, and artist prominence have evolved over time, and what these changes reveal about the shifting landscape of popular music.

We explore two main research questions:

- Question 1: What are the key audio features that define top-charting songs over the past decade?
- Question 2: How have musical trends evolved over time in relation to major industry shifts?

Through detailed data analysis and visualization, we aim to highlight key findings in a compelling and accessible manner, allowing both music enthusiasts and data scientists to gain fresh perspectives on the transformation of the music industry.
